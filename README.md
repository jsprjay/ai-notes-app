# Full-Stack Notes App

A full-stack productivity application built with Angular, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. The app allows authenticated users to create, view, edit, delete, and summarize notes with persistent storage, protected API routes, and responsive UX-focused interactions.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* Angular
* TypeScript
* HTML/CSS

### Backend

* Python
* FastAPI
* SQLAlchemy
* SQLite

## ✨ Features

- User authentication with login and registration
- Protected API routes using JWT authentication
- Create, view, edit, and delete personal notes
- Persistent data storage using SQLite
- RESTful API integration between Angular and FastAPI
- AI-powered note summarization (with mock fallback)
- Loading states for better user feedback
- Inline error handling for failed requests
- Disabled buttons during API calls to prevent duplicate actions
- Empty state messaging when no notes exist
- User-specific note isolation and protected data access

## 🤖 AI Integration

The application includes an AI-powered summarization feature that generates insights from user-created notes.

- Implemented using an API-based architecture
- Includes a mock fallback to enable development without external dependencies
- Designed to be easily extended for real AI integrations
- Includes asynchronous loading states and frontend integration through Angular services

Example use cases:
- Summarizing tasks
- Extracting key topics
- Improving productivity insights

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```text
Angular Frontend
   ↓ Login/Register Request
FastAPI Backend
   ↓ Password Hashing + JWT Creation
JWT Token Returned
   ↓ Stored in Local Storage
Authenticated Requests Sent with Authorization Header

The application uses JWT-based authentication to protect note-related endpoints and ensure users can only access their own data.
```
